```yaml
Customer Coverage:
  Total Customers: 861,927
  With Balance Data: 237,969 (27.61%)
  Transaction History: ~100% for active accounts
  
System Distribution:
  LFS: 237,295 customers (27.53%) - Full data coverage
  WINCORE: 363,883 customers (42.22%) - Limited balance data (24 customers)
  OLIBS724: 650 customers (0.08%) - Full coverage  
  LP: 260,099 customers (30.18%) - No traditional balance products

Balance Data Quality:
  Total Accounts: 414,620
  Total Balance: Rp 176.6 billion
  Average Balance: Rp 425,831 per account
  Currency Support: IDR (primary), USD (FX pockets)
```

#### **Integration Challenges & Solutions**

**Challenge 1: WINCORE Balance Data Gap**
```yaml
Problem: Only 24 WINCORE customers have balance data despite 363,883 total
Root Cause: Different balance reporting system/timing
Impact: Incomplete customer 360 view
Solution: 
  - Implement daily WINCORE balance extract
  - Historical backfill for trend analysis
  - Real-time balance API integration
```

**Challenge 2: LP System Integration**
```yaml
Problem: LP customers (260,099) show no balance accounts
Root Cause: LP is lending-focused, no traditional deposit products  
Impact: Expected behavior, not a data quality issue
Solution:
  - Add loan portfolio data from LP system
  - Create lending-specific analytics tables
  - Integrate credit exposure metrics
```

**Challenge 3: Cross-Platform Customer Tracking**
```yaml
Current State: 11.76% customers use multiple platforms
Data Quality: Good (770,542 unique individuals identified)
Opportunity: Cross-selling analytics and unified customer experience
Solution:
  - Master customer registry with id_number as key
  - Cross-platform journey analytics
  - Unified customer risk assessment
```

### **Recommended Data Architecture Improvements**

#### **1. Real-Time Data Pipeline**
```sql
-- Implement real-time balance updates
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE real_time_customer_balance AS
SELECT 
    customer_id,
    SUM(total_balance) as current_balance,
    CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() as last_updated
FROM intern_dwh_core_daily_closing_balance
WHERE full_date = CURRENT_DATE()
GROUP BY customer_id;

-- Trigger on transaction table to update real-time balances
```

#### **2. Master Data Management**
```sql
-- Create unified customer master
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE customer_master_registry AS
SELECT 
    id_number as master_key,
    ARRAY_AGG(STRUCT(customer_id, customer_source, customer_start_date)) as customer_records,
    MIN(customer_start_date) as first_relationship_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_source) as platform_count,
    SUM(total_balance) as total_relationship_balance
FROM intern_data_mart_customer
WHERE business_date = CURRENT_DATE()
  AND customer_status = 'ACTIVE'
GROUP BY id_number;
```

#### **3. Currency Management System**
```sql
-- Automated FX rate updates
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE fx_rates_daily AS
WITH latest_rates AS (
    SELECT 
        non_idr_transaction_amount_currency as currency,
        AVG(exchange_rate) as avg_rate,
        MIN(exchange_rate) as min_rate,  
        MAX(exchange_rate) as max_rate,
        COUNT(*) as transaction_count,
        DATE(transaction_datetime) as rate_date
    FROM intern_customer_individual_successful_transactions_analytics
    WHERE exchange_rate BETWEEN 1000 AND 20000  -- Realistic IDR/USD range
      AND DATE(transaction_datetime) >= CURRENT_DATE() - 30
    GROUP BY currency, DATE(transaction_datetime)
)
SELECT * FROM latest_rates WHERE currency IS NOT NULL;
```

    SUM(t.transaction_amount) as total_volume,
    AVG(t.transaction_amount) as avg_transaction_amount,
    
    -- Customer behavior
    COUNT(*) * 1.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT t.customer_id) as avg_transactions_per_customer,
    
    -- Temporal patterns  
    COUNT(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(HOUR FROM t.transaction_datetime) BETWEEN 9 AND 17 THEN 1 END) as business_hours_count,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(DAYOFWEEK FROM t.transaction_date) IN (1, 7) THEN 1 END) as weekend_count,
    
    -- Success rate
    COUNT(CASE WHEN t.transaction_status = 'SUCCEED' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as success_rate_percent
    
FROM intern_customer_individual_successful_transactions_analytics t
WHERE t.transaction_date BETWEEN '2025-08-01' AND '2025-08-31'
  AND t.transaction_status = 'SUCCEED'
GROUP BY t.transaction_category, t.payment_service_type
HAVING transaction_count > 1000  -- Focus on significant patterns
ORDER BY total_volume DESC;
```
