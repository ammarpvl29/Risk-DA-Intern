# üìã Next Week Task Guide - Propensity Model Analysis

**Week of**: September 30 - October 4, 2025
**Analyst**: Ammar Siregar
**Mentor**: [Mentor Name]
**Project**: Propensity Loan Take Up 2025 - Phase 2

---

## üéØ **Overview & Context**

Based on your mentor's guidance, you're moving into **Phase 2** of the propensity model project. This phase focuses on understanding carry-over customer behavior and learning to interpret propensity model outputs.

### **Strategic Context**
- **Current State**: Model 1 exists (built by Sefani) for **New customers only**
- **Your Role**: Analyze **Carry-over customers** and their activity patterns
- **Decision Point**: Will your analysis be used for:
  - **Path A**: Descriptive insights/reporting dimensions
  - **Path B**: Feature engineering for ML models

### **Future Model Scenarios**
- **Scenario 2A**: Build separate Model 2 for carry-over customers
- **Scenario 2B**: Build unified model combining both customer types

---

## üìö **Key Concepts to Master**

Before starting, ensure you understand these definitions from your mentor:

### **Customer Types**
- **New Customer**: First-time offer recipient in current period
- **Carry-over Customer**: Previous period customer who didn't accept, now re-engaged

### **Activities & Performance**
- **Activity**: Proactive company engagement (Email=E, WhatsApp=W, Apps=A)
- **Take Up**: Customer accepts/uses an offer
- **Performance**: Activities measured over time periods

### **Time Window Metrics** (Critical for Analysis)
- **Current**: Activities within single analysis period
- **Last One Month**: Rolling total (current + 1 previous period)
- **Last Two Months**: Rolling total (current + 2 previous periods)
- **Ever/Long Time**: Cumulative total across customer history

---

## üéØ **Main Tasks for This Week**

### **Task 1: Deliverables Submission** ‚≠ê **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Deadline**: Early in the week

#### **What to Submit:**
1. **Script 1**: Ad-hoc analysis table creation script (your aggregation query)
2. **Script 2**: Carry-over customer analysis script

#### **Guided Questions:**
- Do you have your final aggregation query properly documented?
- Should you clean up the query and add comprehensive comments?
- What analysis insights about carry-over vs new customers should you include?

---

### **Task 2: The "Ghost" Take-Up Analysis** ‚≠ê **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Objective**: Solve the mystery of carry-over customers who convert without recent activity

#### **The Problem to Investigate:**
- Carry-over customers who suddenly take up offers
- "No wind, no rain, but taken" phenomenon
- These customers may be influenced by **historical activities** from previous periods

#### **Your Analysis Framework:**
1. **Calculate Time Differences**: For customers who take up offers, measure days between:
   - Take-up date
   - Last activity date (Email/WhatsApp/App)

2. **Segment Analysis**: Calculate separately for:
   - New customers
   - Carry-over customers

3. **Draw Insights**: Compare average time differences
   - Similar times (e.g., ~10 days) = recent activity drives conversion
   - Longer times for carry-over (e.g., ~30 days) = historical activities have cumulative effect

#### **Guided Questions to Explore:**
- Which customers in your dataset have `flag_takeup = 1`?
- How can you calculate the time difference between their facility `start_date` and their last notification date?
- What patterns do you see when comparing New vs Carry-over customers?
- Are there customers who converted with very old last activities? What does this mean?

---

### **Task 3: Time-Window Performance Metrics** ‚≠ê **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
**Objective**: Build the foundation for understanding activity attribution windows

#### **Start with "Current" Metrics:**
Your mentor specifically said to focus on **Current** first, then expand.

#### **Implementation Approach:**
- You already have activity counts in your aggregation table
- Now you need to understand how to extend this to rolling time windows
- This will help determine the optimal attribution window for activities

#### **Guided Questions:**
- How does your current aggregation table measure the "Current" time window?
- What additional data would you need to calculate "Last One Month" metrics?
- How might you modify your time window filtering logic to support rolling periods?

---

### **Task 4: Propensity Model Interpretation** ‚≠ê **HIGH PRIORITY**
**Objective**: Learn to read and interpret propensity model outputs

#### **Key Metrics to Master:**
Your mentor wants you to understand:
- **AUC (Area Under the Curve)**
- **Gini coefficient**
- **KS (Kolmogorov-Smirnov) statistic**
- **Score Distribution charts**
- **Feature Importance plots**

#### **Learning Resources:**
- SOP Risk Model document (to be provided by mentor)
- Existing Model 1 report (built by Sefani)

#### **Guided Learning Questions:**
- What does an AUC of 0.75 vs 0.85 mean in business terms?
- How do you interpret a Gini coefficient for loan default prediction?
- What does the KS statistic tell you about model discrimination?
- How do you read feature importance plots to understand which variables drive predictions?
- What makes a "good" score distribution in a propensity model?

#### **Practical Application:**
- Review Model 1's performance on New customers
- Think about how these metrics might change for Carry-over customers
- Consider what "good performance" would look like for your future analysis

- **Tip**: Connect metrics to business decisions

### **Challenge 3: Data Complexity**
