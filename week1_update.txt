‚óè Excellent progress! Your systematic approach is solid. Let me guide you on how to leverage what you've discovered to tackle all these tasks efficiently:

  üéØ STRATEGIC APPROACH BASED ON YOUR FINDINGS

  üîç Key Insights from Your Screening:

  1. Customer has multiple daily snapshots (Aug 30 - Sep 9)
  2. Balance data exists (GoPay Savings + Main Account)
  3. Customer profile is consistent across dates
  4. You have the linkage keys: customer_id and id_number

  üìã SYSTEMATIC APPROACH TO COMPLETE ALL TASKS

  Phase 1: Document Your Screening Process (Tasks 1 & 2)

  Task 1: Table Screening Methodology

  Based on your work, create this framework:

  -- Your Standard Screening Checklist:
  -- Step 1: Basic exploration
  -- Step 2: Pick sample record
  -- Step 3: Check key fields
  -- Step 4: Validate data quality
  -- Step 5: Cross-table linkage test

  Guidance: Turn your current queries into a reusable template - what would you tell the next intern?

  Task 2: Data Quality Framework

  You've already started this! Expand with:

  -- Add these patterns to your current approach:
  -- Duplicate detection across dates
  -- Missing value analysis  
  -- Date range consistency
  -- Cross-table validation

  Key insight from your data: Notice how total_balance appears in both customer AND balance tables - perfect for validation queries!

  ---
  Phase 2: Complete Your Current Screening

  Transaction Screening - Build on Your Pattern:

  -- Follow the same logic you used for balance:
  -- 1. What's the date range?
  -- 2. How many transactions for this customer?
  -- 3. What transaction types?
  -- 4. Does it match the balance changes?

  Loan Screening - Use Your Linkage Keys:

  -- Two approaches to test:
  -- 1. Search by customer_id = 'XNFJK1BX1V'
  -- 2. Search by id_number = '3216084905900007'
  -- This will teach you about table relationships!

  ---
  Phase 3: Analysis Tasks (The Real Business Questions)

  July 25 vs August 25 Pattern Recognition

  You already have the solution pattern from your mentor! Apply it:

  -- Copy your mentor's August 25 query structure
  -- Change only the date filter: '2025-07-25'
  -- Same tables, same joins, different date

  Think: Why might July 25 have different results than August 25?

  Direct Lending Application Analysis

  Use your customer as a test case first:

  -- Test with your known customer:
  -- 1. Was XNFJK1BX1V offered loans on Aug 25?
  -- 2. Did they apply for JAG products?
  -- 3. Scale up to all customers

  Timing Analysis (Same Month vs Next Month)

  The key insight: You need to compare offer_date with application_created_date

  -- Framework to think about:
  -- Offers in August 2025 ‚Üí Applications in August 2025 (same month)
  -- Offers in August 2025 ‚Üí Applications in September 2025 (next month)

  üéì LEARNING STRATEGY FOR EACH TASK

  Task 3: Flow Documentation

  Map out what you did this week:
  Business Question ‚Üí Data Discovery ‚Üí Analysis ‚Üí Insights

  Use your current customer screening as the example!

  Task 4: SQL Mastery

  Practice with your actual data:

  -- GROUP BY: Customer demographics analysis
  -- DISTINCT: Unique values in key fields  
  -- RANK: Customer balance rankings
  -- QUALIFY: Your deduplication approach
  -- CTE: Your balance screening structure
  -- JOIN: Link customer to balance to transactions

  üí° TACTICAL TIPS FOR WEEKEND SUCCESS

  Time Management:

  Saturday AM: Complete your screening template (transactions + loans)
  Saturday PM: Document Tasks 1-3 using your work
  Sunday AM: SQL mastery examples (Task 4)
  Sunday PM: Analysis tasks using mentor's patterns

  Quality Validation Strategy:

  -- For every analysis, include:
  SELECT 'Data Quality Check' as test, COUNT(*) FROM base_table;
  SELECT 'Date Range Check' as test, MIN(date), MAX(date) FROM base_table;
  SELECT 'Key Field Check' as test, COUNT(DISTINCT key_field) FROM base_table;

  Leverage What You Know:

  - Your customer exists across multiple tables ‚úÖ
  - Your balance deduplication works ‚úÖ
  - Your mentor's query patterns work ‚úÖ
  - You understand the data model ‚úÖ

  üéØ NEXT IMMEDIATE ACTIONS

  1. Complete transaction screening using your balance pattern
  2. Test loan screening using both customer_id and id_number
  3. Copy mentor's July 25 query and modify for July 25
  4. Validate with your test customer before scaling up

  Key Questions to Guide You:

  For Screening Tasks:
  - What story does each query tell about the customer?
  - What would concern you about the data quality?
  - How would you explain this process to another intern?

  For Analysis Tasks:
  - Why does Bank Jago care about offer-to-application conversion?
  - What business insight comes from timing analysis?
  - How do the results connect to Bank Jago's lending strategy?

  You're building on solid foundations! Use your systematic approach and extend the patterns you've already established. The hardest part (understanding the data model) is done! üöÄ
