## üîç **Critical Technical Discoveries**

### **1. Data Architecture Breakthrough**
```sql
-- ‚úÖ WORKING JOIN METHOD
customer.customer_cif = facility.CIF  -- Both are customer_id format
```

**Key Discovery**: Initial assumption of hash-based CIF mismatch was incorrect. The `CIF` field in MasterLoanFacility directly equals `customer_id` from the customer table.

### **2. Cross-Platform Customer Linking**
```sql
-- ‚úÖ SUCCESSFUL BRIDGE
LFS_customer.id_number = LP_customer.id_number  -- KTP linking
```

**Validation**: Same customers exist in both LFS (loan offers) and LP (loan facilities) systems, linked via national ID (KTP).

### **3. Name-Based Joining Quality**
```sql
-- ‚úÖ HIGH QUALITY MATCH
UPPER(TRIM(customer.full_name)) = UPPER(TRIM(facility.AccountName))
-- Zero null values in AccountName field
```
