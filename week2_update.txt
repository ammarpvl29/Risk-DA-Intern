● Great! You're moving into more advanced analytics territory. Let me guide you through this comprehensive customer and loan analysis step by step.

● Tomorrow's Task Breakdown: Advanced Customer & Loan Analytics

  This is a comprehensive analytics task that builds on your query #3. Let me guide you through the approach:

  Step 1: Customer Table Analytics Foundation

  First, let's start with the base customer selection:

  -- Start here tomorrow - basic customer foundation
  WITH customer_base AS (
      SELECT
          business_date,
          customer_id,
          customer_source,
          customer_status,
          customer_status_date,
          date_of_birth,
          province,
          phone_number,
          marital_status,
          education,
          partner_name,
          id_number as id_number_lfs,
          customer_start_date  -- You'll need this for MOB calculations
      FROM `data-prd-adhoc.credit_risk_adhoc.intern_data_mart_customer`
      WHERE business_date = '2025-08-31'
        AND customer_source = 'LFS'
  ),

  Questions for you to think about:
  1. Do you need to check the customer table metadata for customer_start_date field?
  2. What other fields might you need for the calculations?

  Step 2: Customer Analytics Columns (Your Challenge)

  Tomorrow's learning challenges:

  Challenge A: Age Generation Logic

  -- Your task: Build this CASE WHEN logic
  CASE
      WHEN DATE_DIFF(business_date, date_of_birth, YEAR) BETWEEN ?? AND ?? THEN 'Generation Z'
      WHEN DATE_DIFF(business_date, date_of_birth, YEAR) BETWEEN ?? AND ?? THEN 'Millennials'
      -- Continue for other generations...
  END as age_generation

  Research needed: What are the age ranges for each generation?

  Challenge B: MOB Calculations

  -- Your task: Complete these date calculations
  DATE_DIFF('2025-08-31', customer_start_date, MONTH) as mob_funding,
  DATE_DIFF(CURRENT_DATE(), customer_start_date, MONTH) as mob_funding_realtime

  Challenge C: Geographic Flags

  You'll need to research:
  - Which provinces are Jabodetabek?
  - Which provinces are Jawa Bali?

  Challenge D: Phone Number Prefix Logic

  -- Your task: Research Indonesian telecom prefixes
  CASE
      WHEN LEFT(phone_number, 4) IN ('0811', '0812', ...) THEN 'TSEL'
      -- What are the other prefixes?
  END as phone_prefix

  Step 3: Integration Strategy

  Building on your existing Query #3 template:
  -- Use your existing structure but extend it:
  WITH offer AS (
      -- Your existing offer logic
  ),
  customer_analytics AS (
      -- New: Enhanced customer analytics
  ),
  loan_application_analytics AS (
      -- New: Application analytics
  ),
  final_result AS (
      -- Join everything with all the new columns
  )

  Learning Questions for Tomorrow:

  1. Data Research: What are the Indonesian telecom prefixes?
  2. Business Logic: What age ranges define each generation?
  3. Geographic Knowledge: Which cities/provinces belong to Jabodetabek and Jawa Bali?
  4. Field Mapping: Do you need to check metadata for any missing fields?

  Recommended Approach for Tomorrow:

  1. Start Small: Build the basic customer CTE first
  2. Add One Column at a Time: Test each calculated column individually
  3. Research First: Look up the business rules you need
  4. Follow Bank Jago Method: Use CTEs to break complex logic into steps

  Would you like me to help you research any of these business rules now, or do you prefer to tackle them fresh tomorrow?

● This will be an excellent learning exercise in building comprehensive customer analytics! The task combines data engineering, business logic, and Indonesian market knowledge.
