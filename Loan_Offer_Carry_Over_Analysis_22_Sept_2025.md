# üìä Loan Offer Carry-Over & Anomaly Analysis

**Analysis Date**: September 22, 2025
**Analyst**: Risk DA Intern
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED & ACTIONABLE**

---

## üéØ **Executive Summary**

This document summarizes the investigation into the composition of the active loan offer population, a critical preparatory step for the **Propensity Loan Take Up 2025** project. The analysis began with a broad exploration and concluded by producing two distinct, final queries that correspond to two strategic business goals.

### **Key Findings**:
-   **"Carry-Over" Cohort Discovery**: A large population of customers exists whose active loan offers were created in months prior to the analysis month. This "carry-over" group is **5 times larger** than the group of customers who received new offers.
-   **Data Anomalies Explained**: The large size of the carry-over group is explained by two data characteristics: some offers have very long initial durations (15+ months), and more importantly, offer expiration dates can be extended over time.
-   **Strategic Choice Defined**: The analysis concluded that the core task is not to find one "correct" answer, but to frame a strategic choice for stakeholders: should the propensity model target **new offers** or **all active offers**?

## üî¨ **Phase 1: Initial Exploration & Discovery**

The analysis began with a broad query to understand the entire population of customers with an active offer on a given month-end. This initial exploration yielded the most critical insight of the analysis.

#### **Exploratory Query**
```sql
-- This query provides the widest possible view of all active offers
WITH offer AS (
  SELECT
    business_date,
    CASE WHEN last_day(date(created_at), month) < business_date THEN 'yes' ELSE 'no' END AS check
  FROM `jago-bank-data-production.dwh_core.loan_offer_daily_snapshot`
  WHERE
    business_date IN ('2025-08-31')
    AND last_day(CAST(expires_at AS date), month) >= last_day(business_date, month)
    AND offer_status NOT LIKE 'BLOCKED'
    AND (last_day(date(agreement_agreed_at), month) >= business_date OR date(agreement_agreed_at) IS NULL)
  QUALIFY DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY business_date, customer_id ORDER BY created_at DESC, expires_at DESC) = 1
)
SELECT
  business_date,
  COUNT(*) AS total_active_offers,
  COUNTIF(check = 'no') AS new_offers,
  COUNTIF(check = 'yes') AS carry_over_offers
FROM offer
GROUP BY business_date;
```

#### **Key Finding: The Scale of the Carry-Over Problem**
The query revealed that the 'carry-over' cohort is the dominant group, making it the central point of ambiguity for the propensity model.

| business_date | total_active_offers | new_offers | carry_over_offers |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2025-08-31 | **336,775** | 53,103 | **283,672** |

## üöÄ **Phase 2: Final Deliverables for Strategic Decision**

After a full analysis, including investigating data anomalies and refining the cohort (filtering for LFS customers), the investigation concluded by producing two final, complete queries. These queries correspond to the two distinct strategic goals identified, and are the primary deliverable for discussion with stakeholders.

### **Query for Goal A: New Offer Performance**
This query answers: "What is the monthly performance of **new offers** for our LFS customers?" It deliberately excludes the 'carry-over' cohort to get a clean metric for new campaigns.

```sql

### **Query for Goal B: All Active Offer Performance**
This query answers: "What is the monthly performance of **all active offers** (new and carry-over) for our LFS customers?" It is identical to the query above, but with the critical `FORMAT_DATE` filter commented out.

```sql
-- Goal B: All Active Offers (New + Carry-Over)
-- The only difference is commenting out the FORMAT_DATE filter in the two latest_offers CTEs

-- In latest_offers CTE:
-- and FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m', date(created_at))=FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m', date(business_date))

-- In latest_offers_aprl CTE:
-- and FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m', date(created_at))=FORMAT_DATE('%Y%m', date(business_date))
```
