Question 1 Answer - Table Differences:

	Key Findings:
	1. loan_offer_current = Current snapshot (815,839 records)
	2. loan_offer_daily_snapshot = Historical daily snapshots (21.9M records across 41 days)
	3. Relationship: current table MATCHES the latest business_date (Sep 11, 2025)

	Schema Differences:
	- daily_snapshot has business_date field for historical tracking
	- current has loan_offer_event_at field (real-time timestamp)
	- Both have expires_at, created_at timestamps

	Date Fields Purpose:
	- business_date: Daily snapshot date (for historical analysis)
	- created_at: When loan offer was originally created
	- expires_at: When loan offer expires
	- loan_offer_event_at: Real-time event timestamp (current table only)

	Usage Pattern:
	- Use current for real-time analysis (latest state)
	- Use daily_snapshot for historical trends and time-series analysis

Question 2 Summary:

	- August 25, 2025: 2 LFS customers offered loans
	- Established customers: 4+ and 2+ years tenure (2021, 2023 startdates)
	- July 25, 2025: 0 LFS customers offered loans

	Key insight: Very targeted approach - loan offers going to mature LFS customers only.

Question 3 Answer:
	- From August 25, 2025 offers ‚Üí Applications: 0 (no 2025 application data available)
	- Direct Lending ('JAD') applications: 0 (JAD pattern not found in current data)

Question 4 Final Answer:

	From August 25, 2025 loan offers ‚Üí JAG facilities (disbursed loans): 0

	Detailed Analysis:
	- 2 LFS customers received loan offers on August 25, 2025
	- 3 total offers (one customer got 2 offers same day)
	- Customer identifiers:
	- Customer 1: id_number = 3277011103890001, customer_cif = 8a85410c85a665e30185ab2a82485eee
	- Customer 2: id_number = 3674022108950005, customer_cif = 8a85488278cef4940178d45a4da241b8
	- JAG facilities for these customers: 0 (no disbursed Direct Lending loans)

	Key Insight: Despite receiving loan offers, neither of the 2 LFS customers from August 25 have JAG-type loan facilities, meaning      
	the offers did not convert to actual disbursed Direct Lending loans.

Question 5 Final Answer:

	MasterLoanFacility Contents Analysis vs Handbook:

	üéØ Available Data Fields:

	1. ‚úÖ Limit (Plafond): Available - Rp 500K to Rp 7M range
	2. ‚úÖ Outstanding: Available - Same as limit (full utilization)
	3. ‚úÖ Tenor: Calculated - 4.1 to 18.2 months range
	4. ‚ùå Interest Rate: NOT FOUND in current schema

	üìä Data vs Handbook Comparison:

	| Field       | Handbook Expectation    | MasterLoanFacility Reality          | Match?     |
	|-------------|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------|
	| Interest    | Risk-based scoring      | Missing (no interest rate field)    | ‚ùå GAP      |
	| Limit       | $50-$5K (Digital Loans) | Rp 500K-7M (~$30-$420)              | ‚úÖ MATCH    |
	| Outstanding | Real-time tracking      | Full utilization (-negative format) | ‚ö†Ô∏è PARTIAL |
	| Tenor       | 3-24 months (Digital)   | 4.1-18.2 months                     | ‚úÖ MATCH    |

	üîç Key Findings:

	‚úÖ What Works:
	- Loan limits align with digital lending expectations
	- Tenor range fits handbook (4-18 months vs 3-24 months expected)
	- Outstanding tracking shows full facility utilization
	- Status = 'A' indicates active facilities

	‚ùå Critical Gaps:
	- No interest rate field - Cannot analyze risk-based pricing
	- Negative values suggest different accounting convention
	- No partial utilization - All loans show full drawdown

	üìù Data Format Notes:
	- Negative amounts likely represent liability/debt accounting
	- Plafond = Outstanding suggests immediate full drawdown
	- Recent dates (Sep 2025) indicate active loan portfolio
